    "* Advantage of list container\n",
    "----------------------------------------\n",
    "1. List data structure got random access of elements\n",
    "by providing index number we can get the respected element\n",
    "2. another important functionality of list is 'cache friendliness'\n",
    "cache : a small memory\n",
    "CPU have lot's of cache, when we need some data, CPU first check the cache, it the data is present it gives us, else go towards RAM\n",
    "this cache, reduces memory usage in much value.\n",
    "\n",
    "List has this same concept,\n",
    "when we take some data from the list, CPU not only fetches that data (element), but aslo prefetches some of the\n",
    "extra element from the list too.\n",
    "so when we make next call, it gives fast result\n",
    "\n",
    "as example\n",
    "l=[10,20,30,40,50]\n",
    "when we call l[0]\n",
    "CPU also prefetches l[1],l[2],l[3] etc\n",
    "so next operation became easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Disadvantages of list container\n",
    "------------------------------------------------\n",
    "1. insertion, deletion is slow\n",
    "in insertion, deletion, we have to move back, move forward every item, so it's much slower. (take linear time O(n) )\n",
    "\n",
    "2. searching is also slow\n",
    "if list not sorted, it'll take max time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "so in list, append() and pop() only works in constant time O(1), else others like\n",
    "insert(), remove(), work in O(n) time."
